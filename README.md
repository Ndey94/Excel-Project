Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze Freshco Hypermarket's sales and operational data using Excel and to present key findings and recommendations using PowerPoint. The analysis focuses on understanding key performance indicators (KPIs), uncovering trends, and providing actionable insights to optimize business strategies. The aim is to improve customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and drive business growth.

Key Insights

The order level analysis revealed that the afternoon slot consistently recorded the highest number of orders, indicating peak activity during midday, likely driven by lunch orders or shopping habits. Discount trends were also analyzed, with a notable increase in average discount percentages from January to September. August showed the highest discount percentage of 20.49% in the afternoon slot, reflecting strategic promotional efforts during this period.

In the completion rate analysis, it was observed that organic sources had the highest completion rates, followed closely by customers acquired through Snapchat. Instagram and offline campaign sources, however, had lower completion rates. Additionally, customers acquired from organic sources displayed the highest lifetime value (LTV), while Snapchat led in generating the highest average revenue per customer.

The customer level analysis highlighted that customer acquisition peaked in January and gradually declined throughout the year, with September recording the lowest number of acquisitions. Product ratings were generally high, with the afternoon time slot receiving the highest customer satisfaction ratings. Most product categories received ratings above 4.8, demonstrating high levels of customer approval.

The delivery analysis identified that delivery times were shorter on weekdays compared to weekends, with afternoon deliveries being the most efficient. Late-night deliveries, however, incurred the highest delivery charges, while morning deliveries were the least expensive, suggesting opportunities for optimizing delivery pricing strategies.

State-wise sales analysis revealed that São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais were the top-performing regions, contributing the most to overall sales. In contrast, states like Rondônia and Acre showed lower sales performance, indicating potential for market expansion in these regions.

Finally, the revenue trends and seasonal sales analysis showed that sales peaked during the second quarter of the year, likely driven by seasonal promotions and holidays. A decline in sales was observed in the fourth quarter, which could be attributed to post-holiday slowdowns. The revenue growth from 2016 to 2018 was steady, showcasing the effectiveness of Freshco's business strategies during this period.

Tools and Technologies

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, pivot tables, and charting to derive insights from the data. Microsoft PowerPoint was used to create a visual presentation of the findings, showcasing the trends and key metrics through various charts and visual aids. These tools were critical in turning raw data into meaningful insights and actionable recommendations.
